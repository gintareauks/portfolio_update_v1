            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I'm a 24 year old from Iceland. I graduated from Da Vinci Institute of Holistic Medicine with a B.S. in Holistic Medicine. Just when I started to build my own business in the health field, I discovered coding and loved it!  
            Today I'm spending every minute of my free time learning and expanding my skills to become a proffesional developer.</p>
            <p>I'm still very passionate about Natural Health and I will never give up on helping people heal themselves. However, I feel that learning to code gives me a lot of excitment. It constantly stimulates my brain, making me feel smarter! 
            Career in tech promises a great financial security as well.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>My goal is to become a proffesional front-end developer and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
            <ul class="skills">
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I’d like to work for a tech company where I could gain great experience in creating good-looking, high quality websites for clients.</p>
            <p>However, my ultimum goal would be to become a freelance web developer so I would also have time to run my natural health practises.</p>
